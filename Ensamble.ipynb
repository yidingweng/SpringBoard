    "# Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the hands-on portion of my [talk on ensemble methods](https://github.com/JeffMacaluso/Talks/blob/master/EnsembleMethods/EnsembleMethods.pptx). If you did not attend that talk and are interested in going through this notebook, I'll make a modified version with more commentary for a blog post and link that here when it's available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: Add link to blog post**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll train a few ensemble models on an artificial dataset for binary classification. We'll use scikit-learn to compare a few different types of ensemble methods, and then use XGBoost and LightGBM for more specialized implementations of gradient boosting. Additionally, we'll go over hyperparameter tuning and discuss a few strategies for tuning ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note here is that we likely won't converge on optimal hyperparameters in this notebook due to the time restrictions of the hands-on portion of the talk. However, the longer blog post version will.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup here is largely a series of import statements, creating an artificial classification dataset with [scikit-learn's make_classification function](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html), and then creating a function to train our models and gather various metrics."

    "\n",
    "The most popular bagging algorithm is the **random forest**. This algorithm works by building a series of decision trees where each tree uses a random selection of variables, and then decision trees vote on the final answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, for each tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a different training sample with replacement (bootstrapping) for the data\n",
    "- For each node, choose a number of random attributes and find the best split\n",
    "- Typically is not pruned in order to have a smaller bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these trees are grown, a majority vote among all of the trees will be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ideas here are that the randomness makes a set of diverse models that helps improve accuracy and using random subsets of features to consider at each split helps make it more efficient to train.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Robustness against over-fitting\n",
    "    - Since the model is created through dense randomness, the generalization is typically better, and you can usually increase the accuracy with the number of trees up until a saturation point\n",
    "- Able to parallelize training multiple trees at once and thus speed up training time"

    "\n",
    "Stacking is the final ensemble technique where we combine several different models into a chain of sorts. It is structured similarly to a neural network where layers of models provide predictions that the next layer then uses as inputs. Ultimately, the meta-classifier creates a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b22447659f3f63822bc97ba3eff8a546-c\">\n",
    "*Source: [Anshul Joshi](https://www.quora.com/What-is-stacking-in-machine-learning)*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a little more nuanced than blending models (averaging their predictions for a final prediction) as the meta-learner learns how useful each of the models are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Can be more performant when properly tuned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Much more computationally costly\n",
    "- More difficult to tune\n",
    "- Complete loss of interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need another function that is similar to our previous one for training the models and getting the results. In this case, we'll deal with one layer of classifiers and use a logistic regression for the meta-learner. We'll use five different algorithms for the first layer, but this function is designed to accept any number of models."

However, research from [James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) have shown that random search tends to converge to good hyperparameters faster than grid search.

    "- **Number of Estimators:** The number of decision trees to be trained\n",
    "    - A higher number typically means better predictions (at the cost of computational power) up until a saturation point where the model begins to overfit\n",
    "- **Max Depth:** How deep a tree can be\n",
    "    - This should ideally be low for gradient boosting and large (or none) for random forests\n",
    "- **Minimum Samples per Split:** The minimum samples considered to split a node\n",
    "    - A higher number typically results in better performance at the cost of computational efficiency\n",
    "- **Minimum Samples per Leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node\n",
    "    - A lower number could potentially result in more noise being captured\n",
    "- **Max Features:** The number of features to consider when looking for the best split\n",
    "    - A lower number typically reduces variance/increases bias and improves computational efficiency\n",
    "- **Max Leaf Nodes:** The maximum number of leaf nodes for the tree\n",
    "    - A smaller number could help prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Learning Rate (gradient boosting only):** The adjustment/step size for each iteration\n",
    "    - A larger step size can help get better performance in fewer iterations, but will plateau at a lower performance\n",
    "    - A smaller step size will require more iterations (number of estimators) but will ultimately achieve a better performance\n",

    "## Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Because random forests are generally robust to overfitting and there aren't as many parameters to control as there are in gradient boosting, our hyperparameter tuning strategy doesn't have to be as nuanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've found that increasing the number of trees has the most direct impact on performance. Because the saturation point of overfitting by too many trees is relatively high for random forests, we can usually increase them until our models take too long to train or there isn't much of a performance gain from using more trees. Scikit-learn's random forest implementation only uses 10 by default, but R's [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf#page=17) package uses 500 by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the first level of complexity to control, so after that it's looking into controlling the max depth for overall model complexity. How this is adjusted depends on if we need to reduce bias or variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also control a few other components like the number of features considered for each split or the minimum samples required for each split/leaf, but these may not have as large of an impact as the number of estimators or max depth."

    "## Gradient Boosted Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Because gradient boosting is used for kaggle-style competitions more commonly than random forests, there are quite a few more established strategies out there. These models can often be more difficult to tune than random forests, but it is a little more nuanced than simply cranking up the number of trees and crossing your fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One crucial hyperparameter that is introduced to gradient boosting is the learning rate. As previously mentioned, this tells us how drastic the adjustments are on our new trees being built. One peculiarity is that learning rates suffer pretty heavily from the [Goldilocks principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) - it has to be just right to have the optimal performance. It also highly depends on the number of trees we're training. Here is a chart that shows the relationship between the number of trees and the learning rate:\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, if we have a low number of trees and a high learning rate, we will get to a good performance faster but we will have a lower top-end performance. Conversely, we can get a better performance with a low learning rate and a lot of trees, but it will take much longer to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the other hyperparameters are either similar to or are the same as those in random forests. However, we'll want to use different value ranges for them because the trees between the two algorithms are inherently different. Random forests use larger, relatively unconstrained trees, but boosting methods use weak learners. These week learners are by definition much less complex, so they are smaller, simpler trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of tuning guides (several are listed [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/configure-gradient-boosting-algorithm/)), but my favorite is this guide from Zhonghua Zhang, the former \\#1 Kaggler in the world:\n",

    "We have been using scikit-learn up until now for our models, but there are more specialized frameworks for gradient boosting in particular. Scikit-learn's gradient boosting algorithm is good, but lacks additional optimization and a few components and options that can be useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to focus on **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**. We'll go into more specifics for each, but both frameworks are focused on speed and performance and have the following advantages & disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "- Ability to parallelize training\n",
    "- Ability to use GPUs\n",
    "- Additional under-the-hood optimization\n",
    "- Can specify loss functions\n",
    "- Additional tuning parameters\n",
    "- Distributed computing options\n",
    "- Native handling of missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Relatively difficult to install\n",
    "- Not as unified integration in older versions\n",
    "\n",
    "So generally speaking, XGBoost and LightGBM are able to train better models faster, but can be more difficult to set up and use."

    "### XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) is an extremely popular framework for gradient boosted trees created by Tianqi Chen, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. It was initially released in 2014, but did not become popular until it started dominating competitions on Kaggle a few years later. It has implementations in several languages, but we will be focusing on the Python implementation. For more history, Tianqi posted [this blog post](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/2016/03/10/story-and-lessons-behind-the-evolution-of-xgboost.html) about the history, philosophy, and learnings behind creating XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, both XGBoost and LightGBM use a series of clever tricks and under-the-hood optimizations that are not included in the Scikit-Learn implementation that make them train better models faster. One example is that XGBoost uses second derivatives to find the optimal constant in each terminal node, whereas other implementations just use the first derivative. This is nearly impossible to unpack without getting into the math, but it should give an idea of the type of under-the-hood optimization that is happening. If you are interested, [here is the XGBoost white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754) that explains a lot of the optimizations.\n",

    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The [installation guide](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html) states that there is only a wheel file on PyPI for the 64-bit version of Linux, so things get a little more complicated for Windows & OSX users. Specifically, you have to build the library from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I do have a workaround for Windows users (sorry OSX users!) that I borrowed from [this blog post](https://medium.com/@rakshithvasudev/how-i-installed-xgboost-after-a-lot-of-hassels-on-my-windows-machine-c53e972e801e). Download the wheel file for your version of Windows and Python [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#xgboost) (cp27/35/36/37 are the version of Python, and win32/\\_amd64 are the versions of Windows), navigate a command window to the directory where you downloaded it, and do a pip install in your command prompt with `pip install xgboost‑0.72‑cp35‑cp35m‑win_amd64.whl` using whichever wheel file you downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know your version of Windows or Python, run the code block below."

    "[LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) is a project from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) that is focused around training gradient boosted trees in a highly efficient and distributed manner. It's generally comparable to XGBoost, but is not as popular because it is much newer. More specifically, LightGBM was released in December, 2016, after XGBoost had taken become the de-facto framework for Kaggle competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental differences between LightGBM and other implementations of gradient boosted trees is that it grows the trees leaf-wise rather than level-wise, which is reportedly able to let them achieve lower loss than level-wise trees:\n",

    "\n",
    "*Source: [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Features.rst)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, LightGBM uses a histogram based algorithm to discretize continuous variables into buckets in order to speed up the training process and reduce the memory requirements. XGBoost has included this in recent versions, but it is not enabled by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other optimizations happening under the hood (listed [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Features.rst)), but those are a few of the main differences from other implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "[The documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/python-package#installation) has installation instructions for LightGBM. It can be installed from PyPI with `pip install lightgbm`, but requires a few things to work - check out the documentation depending on your OS."
